## Our Mission  

We students of Northampton's computer and information technology sector learn many skills in our studies, but we sometimes struggle to find practical applications for said skills outside of the classroom. Our members posses the potential to create something big for themselves and the community using not only what they learn here at Northampton, but also the skills they acquire through their own research and hard work. The Computer Club provides students a chance to put their learning into practice with various competitions and projects. The club can also help point students in the right direction when it comes to looking for resources in: acquiring certifications, portfolio building, studying for exams, interview help, etc.  

Through vision and collaboration, we members of the Northampton Community College Computer Club promise to do our best to aide our fellows on their journey to computer wizardry!
