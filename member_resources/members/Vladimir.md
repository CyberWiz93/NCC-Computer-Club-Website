## Contribution
I'm pretty flexible when it comes down to the project and what I'm able to do, I tend to want to be the jack of all trade depending on the project. I'm able to work on the front-end design, and I'm also willing to help manage the server and get that up and running. Since I'm also majoring in cybersecurity, I'm able to do vulnerability testing.
