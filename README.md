# NCC Computer Club Website 
Hello and welcome to the **Northampton Community College Website repository**! The NCC Computer Club Website repository is the perfect training ground for students of *computer science*, *web development/design*, *infosec*, *CIS*, *networking systems technology*, *application development*, and *system administration* who want to build something real for themselves and the community. 

## Our Mission
We students of Northampton's computer and information technology sector learn many skills in our studies, but we sometimes struggle to find practical applications for said skills outside of the classroom. Our goal is to create a website that emphasises the accomplishments of our organization, connects students, promotes our members potential employers and other outside organizations, while providing a **legacy project** for all future members.

### Year-to-Year Goal
Members of the Computer Club should plan to keep this website updated each year with club news, potential projects, competition opportunities, etc. Most importantly, members need to ensure that the website stays compatible with SEO standards and browser updates, as well as maintaining the domain and servers that host the website.

### Learning Objective
The NCC Computer Club Website repo is run entirely by the members of the club, with various tasks requiring sustantially different skill sets; this means that the full cooperation of the club's members is vital for its maintenance. Though the specifics of each student's chosen field of study will differ– and even students in the same field will have their own specialties– we hope that our members learn from each other and diversify thier skill sets.

### Tabs
GitHub repositories provide various tabs that make collaboration easier for contributors. Please use them accordingly:

#### Issues
We will use the issues tab to declare new features, assign tasks, and bring attention to bugs. Either individual members or teams can be assigned to each issue. Once an issue is claimed, no other member may contribute to it until the issue is either taken care of, or unassigned and reopend. Only administrators may open issues and assign them to members.

#### Discussions
The discussions tab can be used by any member who has access to the repository. This is the place for general questions, concerns, and ideas. Just make sure all discussions are topical.

Within the Discussions menu, there is a tab for *Announcements*. Be on the lookout for administrative announcements which include regular updates and need-to-knows. There is also a *Task Board* for assigning general to-dos to project teams, individuals, or the club as a whole.
